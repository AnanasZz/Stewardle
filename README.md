# Stewardle

Remake of the Stewardle game using Pyxel


## Ideas

We would like to make the game easier to understand, offline, and add different game modes, as well as an "infinite" game mode, which is lacking the web game.

We will start with a pretty small database, but we will try to expand it as we work on the project

## Rules

Press the first three letters of the name of the pilot you think the mystery pilot is. Then release the first letter of the name first. 
Exceptions : Ocon -> OCN
